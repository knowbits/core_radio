## Electron tools

### Electron Forge

* An all-in-one tool for packaging and distributing Electron applications.
* <https://www.electronforge.io>

### Electron Fiddle

* Available as a "dev tool" - download and install on Windows, Mac or Linux.
* The easiest way to get started with Electron.
* <https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle>

*Fiddle is built on Microsoft's excellent [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor), the same editor powering VS Code.

* "Electron Fiddle lets you create and play with small Electron experiments. It greets you with a quick-start template after opening â€“ change a few things, choose the version of Electron you want to run it with, and play around. Then, save your Fiddle either as a GitHub Gist or to a local folder. Once pushed to GitHub, anyone can quickly try your Fiddle out by just entering it in the address bar."
