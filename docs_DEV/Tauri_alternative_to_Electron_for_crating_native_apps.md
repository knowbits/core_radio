## Comparison: Tauri vs. Electron (vs Iconic, React Native, Flutter etc)

Tauri apps are much lighter than Electron apps due to their WebView approach. 
* A sample application built with Electron that weighs more than 52MB would weigh much less, around 3MB, when built with Tauri.

Tauri apps also outperform Electron apps in terms of: 
* Performance, launch time, and memory consumption1.
