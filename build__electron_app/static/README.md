## About the "static" folder

A complaint results if "static" folder is missing when running `npm run pack`

> In the context of Electron applications, the static folder typically  contains “static assets” or files that do not require transpiling, compiling,  or any other processing. 

> These can include images, markdown files, text files, JSON files, etc. 

> These are “non-code assets” that just need to be available1.
