## Mac: How to create a "web app" shortcut on your desktop using Chrome

### Using Chrome

> "Unfortunately, the `--app` option for Chrome is not available on MacOS.

> This option is only available on Windows and Linux. On MacOS, you can create a similar effect by creating a Fluid app, but this requires installing additional software."

### Using safari

> Safari doesn't have a built-in feature to display webpages as minimal web apps without the usual browser interface.

> For this, you would need to use a third-party app like [Unite](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite) or [Fluid](https://fluidapp.com), which allow you to create standalone apps from websites. These apps open in their own windows, without the usual browser interface.

Here's how you can create a minimal web app using "Unite":

1. Download and install [Unite](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite).

2. Open Unite and enter the URL of your static HTML page (e.g.,   `file:///path/to/core_radio.html`).

3. Enter a name for your app (e.g., Radio Streams Player) and choose an icon.

4. Click "Create Unite Application".

5. Now, you have a minimal web app of your static HTML page. You can find it in your `Applications` folder and add it to your dock if you want.

_TBD_: Is it possible to have a custom icon for the shortcut?_

### Using Firefox

To display a static HTML web page as a minimal web app without the usual browser interface in Firefox, you can use a third-party extension called "Minimalist Web Extension".

Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the "Minimalist Web Extension" from the Firefox Add-ons store.
2. Open the static HTML web page `core_radio.html` in Firefox.
3. Click on the "Minimalist Web Extension" icon in the toolbar.
4. Customize the settings according to your preferences, such as hiding the toolbar, navigation buttons, etc.
5. Save the settings and the web page will now be displayed as a minimal web app without the usual browser interface.

_TBD_: Is it possible to have a custom icon for the shortcut?_

### Using Brave

To display a static HTML web page as a minimal web app without the usual browser interface in Brave, you can use a feature called "Brave Web Apps".

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the static HTML web page in Brave.
2. Click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner of the browser window.
3. Select "More Tools" and then "Create Shortcut".
4. Customize the settings according to your preferences, such as hiding the toolbar, navigation buttons, etc.
5. Click "Create" and the web page will now be displayed as a minimal web app without the usual browser interface.
